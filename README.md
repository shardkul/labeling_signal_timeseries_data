# Automatic Labelling
Labelling data can be tedious and time-consuming. This is especially the case when you
have large amounts of data. For data that contains a definite beginning and end, such as
pausing between actions, this can be done automatically. Write an automatic labelling script
for the data provided. Included are 2 sample data files from our collection and labels that
were eventually used.
